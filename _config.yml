user_description: |
  I'm a self-driven, passionate Java developer who loves challenges and creative problem-solving. I also enjoy automating everyday tasks and optimizing them the best I can. I'm a fast-learner: I like to study new technologies and regularly apply my knowledge in practical situations. I firmly believe that great code must be elegant and good-looking, clean, and well documented: this is my aim as a developer. 
  Lately, I also took part in more business-oriented projects that improved my soft skills and broadened my perspective.
